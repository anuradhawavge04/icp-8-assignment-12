            History of Abdul Kalam
        </H2>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
        aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
        raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades
        as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
        military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on
        the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal
        organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
        original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

        Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
        Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he
        returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
        of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

        <h2>Career as a scientist</h2>
        This was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers—Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish
        Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.

        A P J Abdul Kalam[25]

        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
        Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of
        India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started
        his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam
        joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and
        recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station
        (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the
        project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini
        satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
        independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme
        to include more engineers.[25]

        <h2>Books Written By Abdul Kalam</h2>
        Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, also called the Missile Man of India, was a significant source of inspiration for millions
        of Indians. He was a brilliant teacher and an aerospace scientist who presided as India’s 11th president from
        2002 to 2007, earning the nickname “People’s President.” In addition, he was the first president who was Muslim
        to fulfil a full term.

        On October 15, 1931, Kalam was born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He graduated from St. Joseph’s College there with
        a bachelor’s in science in 1954 and from Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) with a master’s in aeronautical
        engineering in 1957.

        In his book India 2020, Kalam fervently supported a development strategy to make India a “knowledge superpower”
        and a developed country by that year. He saw his work on India’s nuclear weapons development as a means of
        staking India’s eventual superpower status.

        When Kalam questioned Pramukh Swami, the spiritual leader of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, about how India
        could realise this five-pronged vision of growth, it was a “transformative moment” in his life, according to
        Kalam. In his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji, released only a month
        before his passing, Kalam describes his spiritual vision for the next 15 years of his life. Pramukh Swami’s
        response—to add a sixth area—developing faith in God and spirituality to overcome the current climate of crime
        and corruption—became the spiritual vision.
        According to reports, there was a sizable market for translated editions of his novels in South Korea.
